# CCCaTT

A type theory for **unbiased cartesian closed categories**. We provide a small proof assistant which you can also [try online](https://smimram.github.io/cccatt/). In order to get used to the syntax, you can have a look at the [test file](test/test.cccatt).

The theory should come up soon.

## Some examples

- [Curry's axioms for Î»-calculus](tests/curry.cccatt)
- [Curien's categorical combinators](tests/catcomb.cccatt)

## Emacs mode

The Emacs mode can be loaded by adding

```
(require 'cccatt-mode "~/path/to/cccatt-mode.el")
```

to you `.emacs` file.
